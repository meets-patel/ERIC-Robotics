Web Application: I chose Flask as it is a lightweight and easy-to-use framework for building web applications in Python.
Unit Tests: Python's built-in unittest module is used for writing unit tests as it provides a simple and effective way to test code.
CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions is chosen for CI/CD automation due to its seamless integration with GitHub repositories and ease of use. It allows us to define workflows using YAML syntax and provides various actions for different tasks.
Testing: Unit tests are run on every push to the repository to ensure the application's functionality remains intact.
Deployment: The application is deployed to Heroku, a popular cloud platform, as it offers a free tier suitable for small projects. Heroku CLI is used for deployment automation.
