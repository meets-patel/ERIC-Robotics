## Web Application:
  - I chose Flask as it is a lightweight and easy-to-use framework for building web applications in Python.

## Unit Tests: 
  - Python's built-in unittest module is used for writing unit tests as it provides a simple and effective way to test code.

## CI/CD Pipeline: 
  - GitHub Actions is chosen for CI/CD automation due to its seamless integration with GitHub repositories and ease of use. It allows us to define workflows using YAML syntax and provides various actions for different tasks.

## Testing: 
  - Unit tests are run on every push to the repository to ensure the application's functionality remains intact.

## Deployment: 
  - The application is deployed to Heroku, a popular cloud platform, as it offers a free tier suitable for small projects. Heroku CLI is used for deployment automation.
